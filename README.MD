## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured to customize the behavior of the script. All variables are optional and have default values as shown below:

| Variable           | Default               | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RETAILERS`        | `["walmart"]`         | A JSON-formatted list of supported retailer coupon pages from Wired.com/coupons. Example: `["walmart", "amazon", "target"]`.                                                                         |
| `APPRISE_ALERTS`   | None                  | A comma-separated list of Apprise notification service URLs to which coupon alerts will be sent. Example: `discord://webhook_id/webhook_token,mailto://user:pass@smtp.example.com`.                   |
| `ALLOW_DUPLICATES` | `False`               | If set to `True`, the script will allow sending duplicate coupons to Apprise alerts. Use this option if you want to be notified about the same coupon multiple times.                                |
| `KEEP_ALIVE`       | `False`               | If set to `True`, the script will run a Flask server to allow Keep-Alive functionality. This can be useful for deployments that need to keep the script running continuously.                        |
